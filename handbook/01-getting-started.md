## So you want to write code for The Ubyssey?

Since 1918, _The Ubyssey_ has been produced entirely by student staff and volunteers, a group that has included writers, editors, photograhpers, videographers and illustrators. In recent years, our team has grown to include developers and designers who help build and maintain new features for our website.

If you are a developer who is looking for more experience, or even if you're new to web development, we'd love to have you join our team of student coders!
