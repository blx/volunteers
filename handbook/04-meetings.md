## Volunteer Meetings

Weekly meetings will be held on __Wednesdays at 5pm in The Ubyssey office__, unless otherwise specified. 

These meetings are a chance to get everybody in the same room to chat about assignments, ongoing projects, and to allow the web developer or anybody else to answer questions about technical problems.

An agenda will be posted before each meeting in the [meetings/](../meetings/) directory. Meeting minutes will be updated after each meeting.
