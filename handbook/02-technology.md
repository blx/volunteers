_An overview of web projects at The Ubyssey._

### Dispatch

[Dispatch](https://github.com/ubyssey/dispatch) is our custom-built publishing platform that powers [www.ubyssey.ca](http://www.ubyssey.ca/). It was created as a replacement for WordPress and was built with flexibily and ease-of-use in mind. Created as an open-source project, Dispatch aims to provide a set of tools that make it easier for journalists to produce high-quality digital content. We've been using it in production for over a year, but it still has a ways to go before reaching a stable release.

__Tech stack:__ Python (Django), JavaScript (React/redux), HTML/CSS

### Salary Database

### Chatbot

Our newest project aims to deliver the news in a new way. We plan to build a chat bot app using Facebook's Messenger API that will send information about campus news to students in a fun, conversational way. The project will be a combination of web development and machine learning, with lots of room for experimentation!
